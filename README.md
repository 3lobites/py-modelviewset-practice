# Author CRUD Implementation

**Please note:** read [the guideline](https://github.com/mate-academy/py-task-guideline/blob/main/README.md)
before starting.

In this task, you should implement full CRUD API the `Author` model.

The `Author` model has the following fields:
- `first_name` (with the `max_length` of 64);
- `last_name` (with the `max_length` of 64);
- `pseudonym` (with the `max_length` of 64, can be null);
- `age` (integer field);
